                <p class="Overview-Text">"At Flipkart, our goal is to use the power of our platform for the good of people and our planet. We are driven by a mission to fulfil our responsibility to the planet and the society as we maximise our efforts to build value for the Indian consumer.</p>

                <p class="Overview-Text">
                    As an early adopter of sustainability in the e-commerce space in India, our endeavour has been to embed sustainability across business strategies and functions. In these past couple of years, we have focused on creating a systems change through thought leadership and effective partnerships to create long term and sustained impact.</p>

                    
                    <p class="Overview-Text">We are investing in continued efforts towards developing a responsible value chain with a focus on mitigating our climate change impact through various supply chain initiatives including adoption of renewable energy, sustainable packaging, electric mobility, waste management, water stewardship and supplier engagement. As e-commerce disrupts the way people shop, our ambition is to involve all our brands and businesses in building a sustainable platform that provides our consumers with trusted ways to shop more sustainably.</p>
                    
                    <p class="Overview-Text">Through our powerful partnerships with communities, civil society organisations, and coalitions, we seek to drive positive impact with ecosystem conversations, enable cross learning and contribute to building a sustainable future for all. As we start our journey, we know that it would not be easy. We believe that it is important to develop a culture of sustainability where we can bring everyone together through our journey."
