                <p class="Overview-Text">"At the ShopEasy Group, solving e-commerce for India is an objective that we take very seriously. At the same time, we must remind ourselves constantly that our work is not just about what we achieve, but how we achieve it.</p>

                <p class="Overview-Text">
                    Success is only meaningful if it is achieved the right way. So while we continue to grow and achieve greater milestones, we are committed to acting with integrity and ensuring that every decision we make is based on ethical and moral principles.</p>

                    
                    <p class="Overview-Text">Our Code of Conduct is built on the theme ‘Integrity Builds Trust’ which aligns with our enterprise objective - of establishing ‘Trust as a Competitive Advantage’. Our Code clearly reflects how our commitment to integrity helps us build trust with our employees, customers, communities, and other stakeholders. At its core is a simple guideline: do the right thing and speak up freely whenever you have a concern or see something out of place.</p>
                    
                    <p class="Overview-Text">Our culture of integrity is what makes us stand out as an organization and defines who we are as a company. Our values are embedded in our vision and it helps us make a difference – to ourselves and to everyone we interact with."
